What happens when you initialise a repository?
You create a hidden git file storage system.

Why do you need to do it?
So you can make commits and work with version control. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
The staging area lets you decide which files to add to a commit.

What value do you think it offers?
Gives you flexibility and power to choose files related to a logical change,
instead of bundling everything together.

How can you use the staging area to make sure 
you have one commit per logical change?
Using git diff you can compare versions of files and 
only introduce one logical change at a time.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? 
Branches would be useful for experimental changes to try different things.

How would branches help?
Branches would allow you to checkout experimental changes for testing.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Diagrams are helpful to map out changes and branches so you understand the flow.

What is the result of merging two branches together? 
Merging two branches combines the changes made on each branch.

Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
It shows which commits are accessible. 

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
Efficiency vs flexibility. Want to make it as efficient as possible but
to avoid errors and mistakes that occur with a blunt instrument.
