When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are collaborating with other people or working across different devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might have made changes that aren't finished enough to share publicly. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are for building off an existing project and sharing publicly,
clones are for building off another project and keeping local, 
branches are for building on your own project in different ways.
